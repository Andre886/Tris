This project is a java application made with netbeans inside the IIS Galileo Galilei Crema. This program simulates the game of Tic Tac Toe (Tris). To import the project open netbeans, select file -> import project -> import from zip -> select de zip downloaded from the RELEASE -> press import.

## 2. First look to the program
the first time you open the program the setup will be displayed: the first screen will ask you to accept the terms of service to continue and press next (if you press next without accepting the terms the program will print an error message).
Immediately afterwards you will find yourself in front of the screen where you will have to enter your personal data including:
- First name
- Surname
- Nickname (used for login)
- Password (used for login)
- Email

Once you have entered the data and pressed next you will be asked to verify your email by entering the code which will be sent to the email indicated during registration. Once your email has been verified you will be able to choose the app theme (light, dark or automatic) and finally you will be taken to the LogIN screen.

## 3. LogIN
Once the setup is completed you will be taken to the login page where you will have to enter the data generated during registration (nickname and password). This information is contained in the two files that were generated during registration: nick.txt and pass.txt
If the data entered is correct you will be taken to the dashboard, otherwise an error message will appear and you will have to try again.
on the login screen there is also a button to remember the logged in user, if this check is selected from the second start of the program the login will be carried out automatically.
